> Now you might be wondering on why we deleted the original homepage and all of our repositories on Github, The reason we did that is because we had to throw everything out of the window and start from scratch since the project was a bit messy and unorganized, That is why we had to delete all of our repositories

### What is Scarlet exactly?
> Scarlet is a Free and Open source Steam alternative, it has security in mind, We do not need any of our user's data because that is against our principals, we believe that everyone, even gamers deserve a privacy respecting gaming platform, and that is why we were established back in January 2021

### Scarlet's backstory
> Scarlet was originally a project by Ali Alshamsi (planetjunkie), it was supposed to be a P2P End To End Encrypted gaming messenger, but then he had the idea of making a steam alternative as he was speaking to Noah on Twitter, they were talking about a chat report system but then after that he had the idea of making it into a gaming platform, Ali and Noah partnered up and made the first Scarlet homepage, and the rest is history.
